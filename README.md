Concord 4 Home Automation Daemon
=============================

This package implements a Linux/Unix system daemon that communicates
with the Home Automation Module for a Concord 4 alarm system.

Other programs can use the daemon to perform actions on the alarm
system using a D-Bus based API, documented [here][dbus-protoocol].

This project includes a command-line utility to allow for easy
scripted control over the alarm system. Eventually, more complicated
client programs may be implemented, such as CoAP servers.

**This project is a work-in-progress and not all documented features are
yet implemented.** Some documented features work differently than how
they are currently implemented. That being said, it does work well for
arming, disarming, and signaling of alarms.

You should make sure that the power to the computer you run this
daemon on will last for at least as long as the alarm system panel
battery. The easiest way to do this is to run the daemon on a small
low-power computer (like a Raspberry Pi) that is powered directly from
the 12v source from the panel. Otherwise, a large-ish UPS will be
needed.

Have a look at at the concordd configuration file (`concordd.conf`
in `src/concordd`) to see what sorts of configuration options and
hooks are available, as well as comments describing how to use them.

## Getting Help ##

If you are having trouble with concordd, you can [file an issue on
github](https://github.com/darconeous/concordd/issues/new).

## Getting, building, and installing via Git ##

First:

	$ git clone git://github.com/darconeous/concordd.git
	$ cd concordd

concordd depends on DBus and optionally libreadline. If you are on
Raspbian, you can get both by doing this:

	$ sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libreadline-dev

If you have all of the autoconf tools installed, you can run
the bootstrap script to get the configure script up and running:

    $ ./bootstrap.sh

Alternatively, if you don't have autoconf installed or running
that script simply didn't work, you can skip it by doing
the following instead:

	$ git archive origin/autoconf/master | tar xvm
	  # Next line is a work-around for timestamp problems
	$ touch aclocal.m4 && touch configure && touch `find . -name '*.in'`

You can then go ahead and run the configure script, make, and install:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

You should then copy concordd.conf over from `/usr/local/etc` to `/etc`
and edit it to your liking:

	$ sudo cp /usr/local/etc/concordd.conf /etc/concordd.conf
	$ sudo nano /etc/concordd.conf

You can then start `concordd`:

    $ /usr/local/bin/concordd -c /etc/concordd.conf -s /dev/ttyUSB0

If you now open up another terminal, you should be able to use
`concordctl` to interact with the alarm system:

	$ concordctl
	concordctl:1> help
	Commands:
	   partition                  Get info about partition
	   system                     Get info about the system
	   arm                        Read or change the partition arm level
	   refresh                    Refresh alarm system state scoreboards
	   panic                      Trigger a panic alarm of the specified type
	   keypad                     Emulate a touchpad on this terminal
	   keypad-input               Simulate button presses on the keypad
	   zone                       Prints out info for one or more zones
	   light                      Prints out info for one or more lights
	   output                     Prints out info for one or more outputs
	   log                        Prints out changes to the system as they occur
	   quit                       Terminate command line mode.
	   help                       Display this help.
	   clear                      Clear shell.

	concordctl:1>

Note that the interactive console shown above will only be available
if libreadline was available. Without it you will need to enter the
commands on the same command line as `concordctl`:

	$ concordctl system
	[
		"panelType" => 20
		"hwRevision" => 1234
		"swRevision" => 12345
		"serialNumber" => 12312312
		"acPowerFailure" => false
		"acPowerFailureChangedTimestamp" => 0
	]

Setting up `concordd` to run as a daemon at startup is left as an
excercise for the reader.
